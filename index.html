    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In Ancient Greece, the gods Zeus and Hera have a son named Hercules. While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' mean and jealous brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Turning to the Fates for help, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow him to free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his demon minions, Pain and Panic, to murder Hercules, providing them with a potion that can strip a god of immortality. The two kidnap the baby and take him down to the valley where they feed him the potion, but before Hercules drinks the last drop, the farmer Amphitryon and his wife Alcmene pass nearby and startle the demons, causing them to drop the bottle and spill the last drop. Hercules is stripped of immortality but retains his god-like strength. Pain and Panic attempt to murder the baby, but Hercules easily overpowers them. Pain and Panic decide not to report their failure to Hades.

        <br/>
        Years later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast for his inability to control his strength and wonders where he came from. After his foster parents reveal the Olympian necklace they found him with, Hercules decides to visit the Temple of Zeus for answers. The temple's statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can earn back his godhood by becoming a "true hero." Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten childhood friend Pegasus to the satyr Philoctetes ("Phil") who is known for training heroes. Phil has retired in frustration after none of his past students managed to earn a constellation in the sky. Zeus obliges Phil to train Hercules anyway. After completing the training, Phil and Hercules head towards Thebes. On the way, they meet Megara ("Meg"), a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur Nessus. After Hercules and the others leave, Meg is revealed to be Hades' slave, who was actually trying to recruit Nessus, and also had sold her soul to Hades previously to save a lover who then left her. When Meg mentions Hercules' encounter, Hades realizes that Pain and Panic failed him and plots to finish off Hercules properly.</p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <h4>Hercules</h4>
        <p>As a gawky and awkward teenager wearing a one-sleeved Greek tunic, Hercules is depicted as tall and thin, with broad, but stooped shoulders, extraordinarily long arms and legs, huge hands and pigeon-toed feet, a long skinny neck, and oversized ears. After completing his hero training, Hercules physically changes to being top-heavy and muscular, having larger biceps and pectorals and thickened neck, as well as a stance that changes from stooped and pigeon-toed to upright, with the chest puffed out and his feet now nicely turned out. However, despite his bravado and becoming the model of physical perfection as an adult, Hercules still retains some of his teenage flaws, such as being shy, awkward, timid, and his clumsiness.</p>

    <h4>Megara</h4>
            <p>Megara (commonly shortened to Meg) is a young woman who used to work for Hades, the Lord of the Underworld. Sometime during the events of Hercules, Meg went to Hades and sold her soul to revive a lover of hers who had died. Hades agreed on the condition that she serve him forever, which she accepted. However, shortly after her lover was revived, he fell in love with someone else and ungratefully left Meg locked in servitude to Hades. While Meg follows Hades' orders, she shows open defiance at times and a cheeky attitude.</p>

    <h4>Phil</h4>
            <p>Philoctetes (Phil for short), is a satyr who is a trainer of aspiring heroes who has often been disappointed by his trainees' shortcomings. He has long-since retired after failing to train a successful hero, but is convinced to train the callow young Hercules. While training Hercules or watching him fight, Phil would constantly utter at least one of his 101 rules. After his training is complete, Phil, Hercules and Pegasus set out for the city of Thebes for Hercules to use his skills and to prove his newfound worth as a hero. Along the way, Hercules saves a woman named Megara from being pestered by the centaur Nessus, though Phil berates Hercules for the sloppy mistakes he made in the fight. While Hercules becomes attracted to Megara, Phil immediately clashes with her, considering her a distraction. </p>

    <h4>Pegasus</h4>
            <p>Pegasus is the winged horse of Hercules, created by Zeus out of clouds. Pegasus is very true and a great "friend" of Hercules and helps in everything. Described by Zeus himself as "a magnificent horse with the brain of a bird", Pegasus' behavior mixes elements of both a steed and a bird, with habits such as clicking his tongue, whistling, and at times, perching on one of Hercules' shoulders. The characterization is under the archetype of a "friendly beast". </p>

    <h4>Hades</h4>
            <p>Hades is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon. Unlike his mythological counterpart, who is typically portrayed as a feared but relatively passive deity, he is a fast-talking, ornery, lord of the underworld: a combination of Satan and a sleazy dodgy persuasive Hollywood agent type/car dealer. He wears a dark robe with a skull-shaped perone fastening his chiton and his hair is a glowing blue flame which flares up whenever he becomes excited or — more famously — flares red whenever he becomes enraged, and can also be extinguished. Hades seeks to overthrow Zeus and rule the universe, in line with other pop-culture Hades's being villainous due to association with death.</p>

    <h4>Pain and Panic</h4>
            <p>Pain and Panic (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer) are a pair of shapeshifting demons who are Hades's minions. Pain is a fat, crimson-shaded demon, and Panic is skinny and turquoise. Panic is paranoid, twitchy, panicky, and easily spooked, as his name suggests, but he appears to be relatively smart and is very cautious. He appears to be more honest than Pain. Pain, on the other hand, is bossy, hot-tempered, and sly, but also clumsy, impulsive and liable to get into painful situations, and seems to be less intelligent than Panic.</p>

    <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
            <p>In 1994, David Zippel was attached to compose the lyrics for the songs for the film, teaming up with Alan Menken. Zippel had previously collaborated with Menken on the cabaret revue titled It's Better With a Band, and the musical Diamonds, directed by Harold Prince. Distinctively for the film, the idea to incorporate gospel music for the songs was suggested by co-screenwriter and co-director John Musker, although Menken preferred "something very classic and Greek—a Candide approach". Musker explained, "Gospel is a storytelling kind of music. It can be exhilarating, especially when it gets everybody on their feet. We were looking for a modern equivalent for the Greek references and this style of music seemed to be entertaining and a real departure at the same time." The Spice Girls were originally approached to portray the Muses following an invitation to sing one of the songs, but declined the offer due to scheduling conflicts.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For the single version of "Go the Distance", Michael Bolton was personally chosen by Menken to record the song, in which Columbia Records paid an undisclosed figure to Walt Disney Records for the rights to the soundtrack. For the Spanish version of the film, "Go the Distance" was redone by Ricky Martin and released as a single under the title "No Importa La Distancia" and was also very successful, both inside and outside the United States. In the Turkish version of the film, "Go the Distance" was sung by Tarkan, who also performed the vocals for the adult Hercules. "Go the Distance" was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, but ultimately lost both to Celine Dion's hit "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic.</p>
